# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a test project to evaluate AI's ability to create a website that visualizes a Zotero library. The repository is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Project Goal

Build a web application that:
- Connects to a Zotero library (via API)
- Visualizes the library contents (papers, citations, relationships)
- Provides an interactive interface for exploring research collections

## Current State

This is a new repository with no implementation yet. When developing this project, you will need to:

1. Choose and set up a technology stack (e.g., React/Vue/Svelte for frontend, Node.js/Python for backend)
2. Integrate with the Zotero API (https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/start)
3. Design and implement visualization components
4. Set up build and development tooling

Update this file as the project structure and conventions are established.
